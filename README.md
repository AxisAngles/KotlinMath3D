This is a work in progress. This is a reference library, feel free to use the code as a reference.

This is an attempt to make a relatively minimal 3D rotations library in Kotlin, compatible with Java.
This should be the best Quaternion and Matrix library out there for Java and Kotlin game dev.
It includes notable improvements over standard algorithms, especially toEulerAngles.
